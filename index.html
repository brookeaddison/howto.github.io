    <h1>How To Build a Personal Website</h1>
    <p>Hey there! I’m going to walk you through how to create yourself a personal web page through GitHub. </p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>Create an account:</b></h3>
    <p>
        The first thing you’re going to want to do is create yourself a GitHub account.
        You can easily do this through the following link (https://github.com/signup).
    </p>
    <h3><b>Create a new repository: </b></h3>
    <p>
        In the top right hand corner of your GitHub account page there are three icons
        including a plus sign with a drop down arrow next to it. Click that icon then click “New Repository.”
    </p>
    <img src = "./newrepository.PNG" />
    <sub> 
        Note: How to create a repository is indicated by a red circle in the above screenshot. 
    </sub>
    <br>
    <img src = "./nameyourrepository.PNG" />
    <p>
        As indicated by the red circle, enter: <b>[whatever your username is].github.io </b>
        From here, as indicated by the red arrow, click <b>Create repository.</b> 

    </p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>Upload files to GitHub:</b></h3>
    <p>You will be sent to a page that looks like this: </p>
    <img src = "uploadexistingfiles.PNG" >
    <p>
        In the blue area you will see, 
        <i>“Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file.
         We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.”</i>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You want to click, <b>uploading an existing file.</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>At this point you want to go to your editor. I am using VS Code. </p>
    <h3><b>In your editor:</b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a <b>New Folder</b> [name it whatever you want].</li>
        <li>Within your <b>New Folder</b> create a <b> New File </b> and name it <b>‘index.html’</b></li>
        <img src = "htmlforindex.PNG" >
        <li>Copy the above code into your index.html file substituting your own header in place of mine. </li>
        <li>Notice that we’re including an image. Find an image and save it to your <b>New Folder.</b></li>
    </ol>
    <sub> 
        Make sure the name of your image file and the image source file in your code match.
    </sub>
    <h3><b>Upload your files from your New Folder into Git: </b></h3>
    <p>
        Now going back to your GitHub page you can either <b>drag and drop</b> your files or <b>search them up.</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>Add <b>both</b> your <b>image file</b> and your <b>index.html</b> file. </li>
            <li>Scroll down and click <b>‘Commit Changes’</b> which will be in green.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src = "commitchanges.PNG" >
    </p>
    <h3><b>View your Repository:</b></h3>
    <p>Now in a new tab, in the browser, search your repository.</p>
    <img src = "viewrepository.PNG" >
